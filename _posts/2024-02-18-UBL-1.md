Indian literary heritage has been blessed with teaching and preachings on almost every subject. There are works which have crossed the barriers of language for greater readability. For example,  _Hāla_‘s  _**Gāthāsaptaśatī**_, authored in  _Prākṛta_  inspired a  _Saṃskṛta_ work called  _**Āryāsaptaśatī**_, authored by  _Govardhanācārya_.

Here's a verse:

> **शतेषु जायते शूरः सहस्रेषु च पण्डितः।  
> वक्ता दशसहस्रेषु दाता भवति वा न वा॥**

_One among the hundred tends to be valiant. One among a thousand tends to be learned man. One of ten thousand tends to be an orator. (But) A donor may be born, or not._

This very popular verse depicts the infrequent occurrence of philanthropist and is often referred for showcasing their high importance. By doing a quick search for finding its source, it turned out to be in  _Skandapurāṇam_[[1]](https://svyoma.github.io/blogs/satesu_jayate_surah.html#footnote-1).

However, one such rendition is found in  _Prākṛta_ work called  _Vasudevahiṇḍī_, authored by  _Saṅghadāsagaṇī_. Authored in 5th century C. E.,  _Vasudevahiṇḍī_  (Wanderings of  _Vasudeva_) is work featuring several tales with several heros from several places and times. It is believed to be a Jaina rendition of long lost Guṇāḍhya's Bṛhatkathā.[[2]](https://svyoma.github.io/blogs/satesu_jayate_surah.html#footnote-2)  The verse is as follows:

> **सतेसु जायते सूरो सहस्सेसु य पंडिओ।  
> वत्ता सयसहस्सेसु दाया जायति वा ण वा॥  
> इंदियाणं जए सूरो धम्मं चरति पंडिओ।  
> वत्ता सच्चवओ होइ दाया भूयहिए रओ॥**[[3]](https://svyoma.github.io/blogs/satesu_jayate_surah.html#footnote-3)

[शतेषु जायते शूरः सहस्रेषु च पण्डितः। वक्ता शतसहस्रेषु दाता जायते वा न वा॥  
इन्द्रियाणां जये शूरो धर्मं चरति पण्डितः। वक्ता सत्यव्रतो भवति दाता भूतहिते रतः॥]

_One among a hundred tends to valiant. One among a thousand tends to be learned man. One among a hundred thousand (lakh) tends to become an orator. (But) A donor may be born, or not._  
_One is (regarded as) valiant when victorious over one's own senses. One is (regarded as) learned when he practiced Dharma. One is (regarded as) orator when he observes (usage) of truth. One is (regarded as) philanthropist when he is engaged in welfare of beings._

This verse occurs in  _kathāmukha_ of  _Vasudevahiṇḍī_. This verse, not only depicts the infrequent occurrence of such personalities, but also goes on to provide chief characteristic of each of them.
