## Introduction

Chittapa or Chittipa or Kṣittapa was a poet from Bhoja’s court. Known through his verses found in various Saṃskṛta anthologies and in Bhoja’s Śṛṅgāraprakāśa, it is safe to say that he would have been a celebrated poet during his times.

*avadheyam: This is part 1 of 4-part blog on life, work, and verses of Chittapa. This part deals with details of his life and a verse.*

## Historic Details:

A lot of details regarding the life of Chittapa are not available. Owing to the fact that he has been quoted in Śṛṅgāra Prakāśa by Bhoja for six stanzas, it is safe to say that he did not flourish later than middle of 11th century.[^1] His verses have been quoted in Kavīndravacanasamuccaya compiled in late 12th century, Saduktikarṇāmṛta compiled by Śrīdharadāsa in early 13th century, and many other anthologies.[^2] He has been mentioned in Prabhāvakacarita (by Prabhācandrasūri – 14th century), Prabandhacintāmaṇi (by Merutaṅgācārya – 14th century), and Bhojaprabandha (by Ballāladeva – 16th century). A Bhīlsā inscription containing eulogy of Sūryadeva is attributed to Mahākavicakravartī Paṇḍita Chittapa.[^3]

## Life of Chittapa:

Some verses quoted in aforementioned anthologies praise king Bhoja. Bhoja’s Śṛṅgāra quotes six stanzas authored by Chittapa. As Bhoja was a great patron of arts and literature, it can be opined that he would have been part of royal court of Bhoja. The mentions in Prabandha Cintāmaṇi[^4], Prabhāvakacaritam[^5], and Bhoja-Prabandha confirm this analogy. According to Prabhāvakacaritam, he was a disciple of Kardamarāja (mentioned in Dhanapāla’s Tilakamañjarī). Purātana Prabandha Saṅgraha (compiled from various manuscripts by Jinavijaya) mentions about Chittipa in one episode as Mahāmātya of Bhoja, however, it doesn’t seem very convincing.

## Works:

Unfortunately, no complete works by Chittapa are available today. However, while mentioning about works attributed to Bhojadeva, NCC mentions “The works mentioned here are prob. attributed to him, and not written by him. It is also believed that most of the works [ Page270b ] mentioned here are written by Cittapa, his court poet.”[^6] Other than his verses quoted in anthologies, the only work attributed to him and available in fragments is eulogy to Sūryadeva at Bhīlsā inscription.

## We Praise Only You!:

>सूर्यो धामवतां न किं न किमयं प्रह्लादकश्चन्द्रमा <br>
>गम्भीरो न किमम्बुधिः क्षितिभृतां रामः स जेता न किम्।  <br>
>किन्त्वेकैकगुणस्तुतौ न हि वयं शक्तास्तदेतद्गुण-<br>
>श्रोतॄणां सुमहोत्सवाय नृपते त्वामेकमेव स्तुमः॥<br>

--- Chittipa (Saduktikarṇāmṛtam - 1387)

### Literal Translation:

Is the Sun not powerful? Does not the Moon bring joy? Is the ocean not deep? Among kings, is not Rāma triumphant? Yet, O King! We lack the strength to praise every virtue adequately. (Thus) For the grand celebration of the hearers of virtues, we praise only one – you.

### Poetic translation (liberty is understood):

*Is the Sun not mighty, its power on display?*<br>
*Does the Moon not bring joy in its nightly array?*<br>  
*Is the ocean not deep, a vast, endless sweep?*<br>
*Among kings, isn't Rāma triumphant, virtues to keep?*<br>
*Yet, O King! To laud every virtue, we falter,*<br>
*In this grand celebration, our praise won't alter.*<br>  
*For the hearers of virtues, in this lyrical cue,*<br>
*Our anthem is one – resounding praise for you.*<br>

### Hindi Translation:

क्या सूर्य शक्तिशाली नहीं है? क्या चन्द्र आह्लक नहीं है? क्या समुद्र गंभीर नहीं है? क्या राजाओमें श्रीराम जेता नहीं है? किन्तु इन प्रत्येक गुणों की स्तुति करने में असमर्थ हम, हे राजन्! इन आपके गुणों के श्रवण में तत्पर लोगों के महोत्सव के लिए हम एक - आपकी ही स्तुति करते है।
