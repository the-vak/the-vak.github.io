# दो लोग - The Two People


## Introduction


In the rich literary heritage Saṃskṛta possesses, just like a single work is contained with ability to prosper with attaining unprecedented fame as a completely sub-genre in itself. For example, Meghadūtam/Meghasandeśa by Kālidāsa opened new horizons in development a subgenre of dūtakāvya which includes works like Pānthadūtam, Kokilasandeśaḥ, Tulasīdūtam, Bhramarasūtam, Indudūtam, Pārśvābhyudaya, Cetodūtam, etc., to name a few.

Similar is observed in verses as well. An idea of telling about two types of people in the world have attained the same fate. 

## Mutable and Immutable


The oldest verse of this kind is as old of Śrīmad Bhagvad Gītā which forms part of Bhīṣma Parva of Mahābhārata.

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके क्षरश्चाक्षर एव च। <br /> 
> क्षरः सर्वाणि भूतानि कूटस्थोऽक्षर उच्यते॥

_There are two entities in this universe: perishable and imperishable. All creatures are perishable while unconcerned one is the imperishable. (M. N. Dutt)_

_There are these two entities in the world, viz., the mutable and the immutable. The mutable is all (these) creatures. The unchangeable one is called the immutable. (Roy-Ganguli)_

## A worthy king and Brāhmaṇa

> द्वाविमौ ग्रसते भूमिः सर्पो बिलशयानिव।  <br />
राजानं चाविरोद्धारं ब्राह्मणं चाप्रवासिनम् ॥

Adhyāya 33 (Prajāgara Parva), Udyoga Parva (Mahābhārata)

_Even as a serpent devours animals living in holes, the earth devours these two, viz., a king who is incompetent to fight, and a Brāhmaṇa who doth not sojourn to holy places._

## The courageous ones!

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके सूर्यमण्डलभेदिनौ।  <br />
परिव्राड् योगयुक्तश्च रणे चाभिमुखो हतः॥

Parāśaradharmasaṃhitā (Parāśarasmṛti) 3.30; Also Sūktiratnakoṣa - SRK

_These two individuals shall break the solar system: the ascetic endowed with yoga and the warrior who dies facing the battle._

## Whom we rely upon

Various other similar verses are collected in Saṃskṛta anthologies. They include:

> द्वाविमावपि लोकेऽस्मिन् परप्रत्ययकारकौ।  ( var. द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके, द्वाविमौ पुरुषव्याघ्र! - Mahābhārata) <br />
स्त्रियः कामितकामिन्यो लोकः पूजितपूजकः॥ 

Adhyāya 33 (Prajāgara Parva), Udyoga Parva (Mahābhārata); Also Subhāṣitaratnabhāṇḍāgāram – SRB, SRK

_In this world, there are two kinds of individuals who can be relied upon by others. Women who desire what they already have, and people who honor those already respected by society._

## Forgiving master and Generous poor? 

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके स्वर्गस्योपरि तिष्ठतः।  <br />
प्रभुश्च क्षमया युक्तो दरिद्रश्च प्रदानवान्॥

Adhyāya 33 (Prajāgara Parva), Udyoga Parva (Mahābhārata), SRB, SRK, SH

_These two types of individuals reside above even heaven. The forgiving master and the generous poor person._

## Traits of uncontent

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके सुखिनौ न कदाचन। (var. द्वाविमौ कण्टकौ राजन् शरीरपरिशोषिणौ। - Nītikalpataru)  <br />
यश्चाधनः कामयते यश्च कुप्यत्यनीश्वरः॥

SRB, SRK, Subhāṣita Hārāvalī - SH

_These two types of individuals are never content. The one who lacks wealth but desires, and the one who becomes angry, though not having wealth._

## Na hua, na hoga

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके न भूतौ न भविष्यतः।  <br />
प्रार्थितं यश्च कुरुते यश्च नार्थयते परम्॥

SRB, SRK

_These two kinds of people have never been born or will never born - one who does what is asked for and one who doesn't ask for more._

## Right thing at right time

A very similar verse is quoted in Subhāṣitāvalī -

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके स्वर्गस्योपरि तिष्ठतः।  <br />
अन्नदाता च दुर्भिक्षे सुभिक्षे च हिरण्यदः॥

Subhāṣitāvalī

_These two individuals reside above even heaven. The provider of food in famine and gold in abundance._

## A complete head-ache

> द्वाविमौ पुरुषो लोके शिरःशूलकरौ परौ।  
गृहस्थो यो निरारम्भो यतिश्च सपरिग्रहः॥

SRB, SRK, SH

_These two types of individuals are the greatest causes of headaches: the householder avoiding all work and a monk with possessions._

## Just tie them and throw

> द्वाविमावम्भसि क्षेप्यौ गाढं बद्ध्वा गले शिलाम्।  <br />
धनिनं चाप्रदातारं दरिद्रञ्चातपस्विनम्॥

SRK, SRK, SH

_These two kinds of people shall be tightly tied with rock in their neck and cast off in the waters – an ungenerous wealthy and lapsed poor._

## No vairāgya :/

> द्वाविमौ न विरज्येते विपरीतेन कर्मणा ।  <br />
निरारम्भो गृहस्थश्च कार्यवांश्चैव भिक्षुकः ॥ ३०॥

Nāradaparivrajākopaniṣat

These two people never get discontented due to inauspicious karma – a householder abstaining from activities and a beggar with work.

## A reproduction of an older verse

Among the literary works, Rāmacandrasūri’s Satyahariścandranāṭakam tries to reproduce the essence similar to verse from Mahābhārata.

> न जातौ न जनिष्येते द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ भुवि।  <br />
अर्थितो यः करोत्येव यश्च नाऽर्थयते परम्॥

Satyahariścandranāṭakam

_These two people are neither born nor will take birth in future. One who does what is asked for and other who doesn’t ask for more._
